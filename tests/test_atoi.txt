Libft - ft_atoi 游릭游댮

Evil tests made with 游땓游땓游땓 passion

Context : The atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string
       pointed to by nptr to int.  The behavior is the same as
	   strtol(nptr, NULL, 10)

		The strtol() function converts the initial part of the string in
       nptr to a long integer value according to the given base, which
       must be between 2 and 36 inclusive, or be the special value 0.

	   The string may begin with an arbitrary amount of white space (as
       determined by isspace(3)) followed by a single optional '+' or
       '-' sign.

	   The remainder of the string is converted to a long value in the
       obvious manner, stopping at the first character which is not a
       valid digit in the given base. 

Test material
	- str type char ex : ""
	- Original atoi (#include <stdlib.h>) for comparison

Prototype
