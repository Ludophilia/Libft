Libft - ft_memcpy 游릭游댮

Evil tests made with 游땓游땓游땓 passion

Context : The memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to
memory area dest.  The memory areas must not overlap.  Use
memmove(3) if the memory areas do overlap.

Test material
	- Array 1 of char of 5 elements or space allocated via malloc
	- Array 2 of char of 5 elements or space allocated via malloc
	- Original memcpy (#include <string.h>) for comparison

[游릭] Happy path
	ft_memcpy(arr2, arr1, 3)
		-> 3 bytes copied from arr2 to arr1

[游릭] Exact size
	ft_memcpy(arr2, arr1, 5)
		-> 5 bytes copied from arr2 to arr1

[游릭] Invalid memory address;
	ft_memcpy((void *)0, arr1, 1)
		-> Segfault / Undefined behavior
	ft_memcpy(arr2, (void *)0, 1)
		-> Segfault / Undefined behavior
	
[游댮] Overlapping memory address
	ft_memcpy(arr1 + 1, arr1, 3)
		-> Undefined behavior (The first byte of arr1 could be copied 3
		times for exmample, as what's been written before is used as source
		for the next turn)

[游릭] No size
	ft_memset(arr, '0', 0)
		-> Nothing changes in arr

[游릭] Size too long
	ft_memset(arr, 10, 10)
		-> Write as much as needed (+ Undefined behavior - *** stack smashing 
		detected ***)
